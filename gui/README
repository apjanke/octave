Quint is using the QTermWidget to emulate a terminal, this enabling readline support for Octave. This is the original README file from the author:

QTermWidget
version 0.1.0

QTermWidget is an opensource project based on KDE4 Konsole application.
The main goal of this project is to provide unicode-enabled, embeddable
QT widget for using as a built-in console (or terminal emulation widget).

Of course I`m aware about embedding abilities of original Konsole,
but once I had Qt without KDE, and it was a serious obstacle.
I decided not to rely on a chance. I cannot find any interesting related project,
so I had to write it.

The original Konsole`s code was rewritten entirely with QT4 only; also I have to
include in the project some parts of code from kde core library. All code dealing
with user interface parts and session managers was removed (maybe later I bring it
back somehow), and the result is quite useful, I suppose.

This library was compiled and tested on three linux systems,
based on 2.4.32, 2.6.20, 2.6.23 kernels, x86 and amd64.
Please inform about its behaviour on other systems.

If you cannot launch Quint because it fails to find octave's shared libraries and you are sure that you have them installed, you will need
to do an

export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/lib/octave-x.x.x/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH && bin/Quint

and replace x.x.x by the specific octave version you have installed to run Quint. If you don't want to do that each time you launch Quint,
do the following:

sudo gedit /etc/ld.so.conf 

and append the line:

/usr/lib/octave-x.x.x/

Save the file and do:

sudo ldconfig

Now Quint should not complain about missing shared libraries. If you have any problems, suggestions or ideas, feel free to drop me a mail at
