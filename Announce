Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed.

This is a bug-fixing release.  There are only a few new features:

  * If the argument to eig() is symmetric, Octave uses the specialized
    Lapack subroutine for symmetric matrices for a significant
    increase in performance.

  * It is now possible to use the mkoctfile script to create .oct
    files from multiple source and object files.

Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
