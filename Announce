In addition to the source distributions, there are binary
distributions available for Linux running on Intel systems and OSF/1
running on Alpha systems.  Binary distributions for other platforms
will be available from ftp.che.wisc.edu when they are contributed by
volunteers.  If you would like to help to make a binary distribution
available, please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.

Version 2.0.2 is primarily a bug-fixing release.  Most bugs reported
since the release of version 2.0.1 have been fixed.  There are also a
few new features, including:

  * Octave now stops executing commands from a script file if an error
    is encountered.

  * The return, and break commands now cause Octave to quit executing
    commands from script files.  When used in invalid contexts, the
    break, continue, and return commands are now simply ignored
    instead of producing parse errors.

  * size ("") is now [0, 0].

  * New functions:

      sleep   -- pause execution for a specified number of seconds
      usleep  -- pause execution for a specified number of microseconds

You can help make Octave more reliable by reporting any bugs you find
to bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.

Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with Matlab.
