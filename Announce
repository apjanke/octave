Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed.

This is mostly a bug-fixing release, but there is an important
user-visible change:

  * There are two new built-in variables that control how global
    variables are initialized.  If `initialize_global_variables' is
    nonzero, global variables are initialized to the value of the
    variable `default_global_variable_value'.  The default value of
    `initialize_global_variables' is 0 (1 if you use --traditional)
    and `default_global_variable_value' is undefined (the empty matrix
    if you use --traditional).  The default settings are compatible
    with versions of Octave before 2.0.10.


Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
