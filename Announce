Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed.

This is a bug-fixing release, but there is one new user-visible
feature:

  * It is now possible to specify a label for lines in the plot key
    when using the plot function.  For example,

      plot (x, y, "-*;sin(x);")

    plots y vs. x using the linespoints style and sets the title of
    the line in the key to be `sin(x)'.

Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
