Version 2.0.4 fixes some problems with the configure scripts and
Makefiles that were present in 2.0.3.  It will probably be the last
2.0.x release unless some serious new bugs are found and reported.

There are also two new features (what would be the fun of making a
release just to fix bugs? :-) both of which are kluges to allow a bit
more compatibility with Matlab:

  * It is now possible to use commands like ls, save, and cd as simple
    variable names.  They still cannot be used as formal parameters
    for functions, or as the names of structure variables.  Failed
    assignments leave them undefined (you can recover the orginal
    function definition using clear).

  * Is is now possible to invoke commands like ls, save, and cd as
    normal functions (for example, load ("foo", "x", "y", "z")).

You can help make Octave more reliable by reporting any bugs you find
to bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.

Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with Matlab.
