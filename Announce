Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed.

There are two new features:

  * The new built-in variable default_eval_print_flag controls whether
    Octave prints the results of commands executed by eval() that do
    not end with semicolons.  The default is 1.

  * The new built-in constant OCTAVE_HOME specifies the top-level
    directory where Octave is installed.

Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
