Most bugs reported since the release of version 2.0 have been fixed
and this will probably be the last in the series of 2.0.x releases
unless some serious new bugs are found and reported.

There are two new features:

  * A `switch' statement is now available for compatibility with
    MATLAB 5.  See the Statements chapter in the manual for details.

  * Commands like ls, save, and cd may now also be used as formal
    parameters for functions.

Version 2.0.5 also includes about 1400 tests (up from about 560) but
more are needed.  If you would like to help improve Octave by writing
additional tests, please contact bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.  You
can also help make Octave more reliable by reporting any bugs you find
to bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.

Octave is a high-level interactive language primarily intended for
numerical computations.  It is mostly compatible with MATLAB.
