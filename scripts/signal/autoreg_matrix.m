## usage:  X = autoreg_matrix (y, k)
##
## Given a time series (vector) y, returns a matrix X with ones in the
## first column and the first k lagged values of y in the other columns.
## I.e., for t > k, [1, y(t-1), ..., y(t-k)] is the t-th row of X. X can
## be used as regressor matrix in autoregressions.
