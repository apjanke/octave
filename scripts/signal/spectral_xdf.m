## usage:  retval = spectral_xdf (X, [win, [b]])
## 
## Returns the spectral density estimator.
## X ....... data vector
## win ..... window name, eg. "triangle" or "rectangle"
##           spectral_adf searches for a function called win_sw ()
## b ....... bandwidth
## 
## If win is omitted, the triangle window is used as default.
## If b is omitted, 1 / sqrt (length (X)) is used as default.
