## usage:  retval = spectral_adf (c, [win, [b]])
## 
## Returns the spectral density estimator.
## c ....... vector of autocovariances (starting at lag 0)
## win ..... window name, eg. "triangle" or "rectangle"
##           spectral_adf searches for a function called win_lw ()
## b ....... bandwidth
## 
## If win is omitted, the triangle window is used as default.
## If b is omitted, 1 / sqrt( length (c)) is used as default.
