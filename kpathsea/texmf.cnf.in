% original texmf.cnf -- runtime path configuration file for kpathsea.
% (If you change or delete `original' on the previous line, the
% distribution won't install its version over yours.)
% Public domain.
% 
% What follows is a super-summary of what this .cnf file can
% contain. Please read the Kpathsea manual for more information.
% 
% texmf.cnf is generated from texmf.cnf.in, by replacing @var@ with the
% value of the Make variable `var', via a sed file texmf.sed, generated
% (once) by kpathsea/Makefile (itself generated from kpathsea/Makefile.in
% by configure).
% 
% Any identifier (sticking to A-Za-z_ for names is safest) can be assigned.
% The `=' (and surrounding spaces) is optional.
% No % or @ in texmf.cnf.in, for the sake of autogeneration.
% (However, %'s and @'s can be edited into texmf.cnf or put in envvar values.)
% $foo (or ${foo}) in a value expands to the envvar or cnf value of foo.
% 
% Earlier entries (in the same or another file) override later ones, and
% an environment variable foo overrides any texmf.cnf definition of foo.
% 
% All definitions are read before anything is expanded, so you can use
% variables before they are defined. 
% 
% If a variable assignment is qualified with `.PROGRAM', it is ignored
% unless the current executable (last filename component of argv[0]) is
% named PROGRAM.  This foo.PROGRAM construct is not recognized on the
% right-hand side. For environment variables, use FOO_PROGRAM.
% 
% Which file formats use which paths for searches is described in the
% various programs' and the kpathsea documentation.
% 
% // means to search subdirectories (recursively).
% A leading !! means to look only in the ls-R db, never on the disk.
% A leading/trailing/doubled : in the paths will be expanded into the
%   compile-time default. Probably not what you want.


%  Part 1: Search paths and directories.

% The root of everything below.
prefix = @prefix@

% You can set an environment variable to override this if you're testing
% a new TeX tree, without changing anything else.
% 
% You may wish to use one of the $SELFAUTO... variables here so TeX will
% find where to look dynamically.  See the manual and the definition
% below of TEXMFCNF.
% 
% If you have multiple trees, you can use shell brace notation, for example:
% TEXMF = {/usr/local/mytex,/usr/local/othertex}
% Also set TEXMFDBS to /usr/local/mytex:/usr/local/othertex,
%  and set TEXMFMAIN to whichever is the main tree (with ./web2c, etc.),
%  and set TEXMFLS_R to the tree where you want generated files to go
% 
TEXMF = @texmf@
% Change this if you have multiple trees or MakeTeX* will fail:
TEXMFMAIN = $TEXMF
% (this is the default) TEXMFLS_R = $TEXMFMAIN
% (this is the default) TEXMFCNF_DIR = $TEXMFMAIN

% Where to look for ls-R files.  There need not be an ls-R in the
% directories in this path, but if there is one, Kpathsea will use it.

%  Part 3: Array and other sizes for TeX (and Metafont and MetaPost).
% 
% If you want to change some of these sizes only for a certain TeX
% variant, the usual dot notation works, e.g.,
% main_memory.hugetex = 20000000
% 
% If a change here appears to be ignored, try redumping the format file.

% Memory. Must be less than 8,000,000 total.
% 
% main_memory is relevant only to initex, extra_mem_* only to non-ini.
% Thus, have to redump the .fmt file after changing main_memory; to add
% to existing fmt files, increase extra_mem_*.  (To get an idea of how
% much, try \tracingstats=2 in your TeX source file;
% web2c/tests/memtest.tex might also be interesting.)
% 
% To increase space for boxes (as might be needed by, e.g., PiCTeX),
% increase extra_mem_bot.
% 
% For some xy-pic samples, you may need as much as 700000 words of memory.
% For the vast majority of documents, 60000 or less will do.
% 
main_memory = 263000 % words of inimemory available; also applies to inimf&mp
extra_mem_top = 0    % extra high memory for chars, tokens, etc.
extra_mem_bot = 0    % extra low memory for boxes, glue, breakpoints, etc.

% Words of font info for TeX (total size of all TFM files, approximately). 
font_mem_size = 100000

% Total number of fonts. Must be >= 50 and <= 2000 (without tex.ch changes).
font_max = 500

% Extra space for the hash table of control sequences (which allows 10K
% names as distributed).
hash_extra = 0

% Max number of characters in all strings, including all error messages,
% help texts, font names, control sequences.  These values apply to TeX and MP.
pool_size = 125000		
% Minimum pool space after TeX/MP's own strings; must be at least
% 25000 less than pool_size, but doesn't need to be nearly that large.
string_vacancies = 25000
max_strings = 15000		% max number of strings
pool_free = 5000		% min pool space left after loading .fmt

% Hyphenation trie. As distributed, the maximum is 65535; this should
% work unless `unsigned short' is not supported or is smaller than 16
% bits.  This value should suffice for UK English, US English, French,
% and German (for example).  To increase, you must change
% `ssup_trie_opcode' and `ssup_trie_size' in tex.ch (and rebuild TeX);
% the trie will then consume four bytes per entry, instead of two.
% 
% US English, German, and Portuguese: 30000.
% German: 14000.
% US English: 10000.
% 
trie_size = 64000

hyph_size = 1000        % number of hyphenation exceptions, >610 and <32767.
buf_size = 3000		% max length of input lines or control sequence names
nest_size = 100		% simultaneous semantic levels (e.g., groups)
max_in_open = 15	% simultaneous input files and error insertions
param_size = 500	% simultaneous macro parameters
save_size = 4000	% for saving values outside current group
stack_size = 300	% simultaneous input sources

% These work best if they are the same as the I/O buffer size, but it
% doesn't matter much.  Must be a multiple of 8.
dvi_buf_size = 16384 % TeX
gf_buf_size = 16384  % MF

% It's probably inadvisable to change these. At any rate, we must have:
% 45 < error_line      < 255;
% 30 < half_error_line < error_line - 15;
%      max_print_line  < 60 ;
% These apply to Metafont and MetaPost as well.
