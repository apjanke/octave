<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient command line interface for
solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and for performing
other numerical experiments.  It may also be used as a batch-oriented
language.

<p>
Octave is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the
<a href="http://www.che.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(octave)Copying">GNU
General Public License</a> as published by the Free Software

<h2><a name="Availability">Availability</a></h2>
<p>
The latest released version of Octave is always available via
anonymous ftp from
<a href="ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave">ftp://ftp.che.wisc.edu/pub/octave</a>.
Complete source and binaries for several popular systems are available.
</p>

<h2><a name="Installation and Bugs">Installation and Bugs</a></h2>
<p>
Octave requires approximately 125MB of disk storage to unpack and
compile from source (significantly less if you don't compile with
debugging symbols or create shared libraries).  Once installed, Octave
requires approximately 65MB of disk space (again, considerably less if
you don't build shared libraries or the binaries and libraries do not
include debugging symbols).
</p>

<p>
In order to build Octave, you will need a current version of g++,
libg++, and GNU make.  Recommended versions are g++ 2.7.2 or 2.7.2.1,
libg++ 2.7.1 or 2.7.2, and make 3.75.
</p>

<p>
<b>You must have GNU Make to compile Octave</b>.  Octave's Makefiles
use features of GNU Make that are not present in other versions of
make. GNU Make is very portable and easy to install.
</p>

<p>
See the notes in the files INSTALL and INSTALL.OCTAVE for more
specific installation instructions, including directions for
installing Octave from a binary distribution.
</p>

<p>
The file BUGS contains a recommended procedure for reporting bugs, as
well as a list of known problems and possible fixes.
</p>

<h2><a name="Documentation">Documentation</a></h2>

<p>
Octave's manual has been revised for version 2.0, but it is lagging a
bit behind the development of the software.  In particular, there is
currently no complete documentation of the C++ class libraries or the
support for dynamic linking and user-defined data types.  If you
notice ommissions or inconsistencies, please report them as bugs to
bug-octave@bevo.che.wisc.edu.  Specific suggestions for ways to
improve Octave and its documentation are always welcome.
</p>

<h2><a name="Implemenation">Implemenation</a></h2>
<p>
Octave is being developed with the Free Software Foundation's make,
bison (a replacement for YACC), flex (a replacement for lex), gcc/g++,
and libg++ on a SPARCstation II and a DECstation 5000/240.  It should
be possible to install it on any machine that runs GCC/G++.  It may
also be possible to install it using other implementations of these
tools, but it will most certainly require much more work.  Do yourself
a favor and get the GNU development tools, either via anonymous ftp
from prep.ai.mit.edu or by writing the Free Software Foundation, 675
Mass Ave, Cambridge, MA 02139, USA.
</p>

<p>
The underlying numerical solvers are currently standard Fortran ones
like Lapack, Linpack, Odepack, the Blas, etc., packaged in a library
of C++ classes (see the files in the libcruft and liboctave
subdirectories).  If possible, the Fortran subroutines are compiled
with the system's Fortran compiler, and called directly from the C++
functions.  If that's not possible, they are translated with f2c and
compiled with a C compiler.  Better performance is usually achieved if
the intermediate translation to C is avoided.
</p>

<p>
The library of C++ classes may also be useful by itself.
