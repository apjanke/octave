<title> Preface to the Octave Manual </title>

<h2>Preface</h2>
<p>
Octave was originally intended to be companion software for an
undergraduate-level textbook on chemical reactor design being written by
James B. Rawlings of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and John
G. Ekerdt of the University of Texas.
</p>

<p>
Clearly, Octave is now much more than just another `courseware' package
with limited utility beyond the classroom.  Although our initial goals
were somewhat vague, we knew that we wanted to create something that
would enable students to solve realistic problems, and that they could
use for many things other than chemical reactor design problems.
</p>

<p>
There are those who would say that we should be teaching the students
Fortran instead, because that is the computer language of engineering,
but every time we have tried that, the students have spent far too much
time trying to figure out why their Fortran code crashes and not enough
time learning about chemical engineering.  With Octave, most students
pick up the basics quickly, and are using it confidently in just a few
hours.
</p>

<p>
Although it was originally intended to be used to teach reactor design,
it has been used in several other undergraduate and graduate
courses in the Chemical Engineering Department at the University of
Texas, and the math department at the University of Texas has been using
it for teaching differential equations and linear algebra as well.  If
you find it useful, please let us know.  We are always interested to
find out how Octave is being used in other places.
</p>

<p>
Virtually everyone thinks that the name Octave has something to do with
music, but it is actually the name of a former
<a href="http://www.che.orst.edu/faculty/profs.html">professor</a>
of mine who wrote a famous textbook on chemical reaction engineering,
and who was also well known for his ability to do quick `back of the
envelope' calculations.  We hope that this software will make it
possible for many people to do more ambitious computations just as
easily.
</p>

<p>
Everyone is encouraged to share this software with others under the
terms of the
<a href="http://www.che.wisc.edu/cgi-bin/info2www?(octave)Copying">GNU
General Public License</a> as described at the beginning of this
manual.  You are also encouraged to help make Octave more useful by
writing and contributing additional functions for it, and by reporting
any problems you may have.
</p>

<p>
Many people have already contributed to Octave's development.  In
addition to John W. Eaton, the following people have helped write parts
of Octave or helped out in various other ways.
</p>

<ul>
<li><em>Thomas Baier</em> (baier@ci.tuwien.ac.at) wrote the original
versions of <tt>popen</tt>, <tt>pclose</tt>, <tt>execute</tt>,
<tt>sync_system</tt>, and <tt>async_system</tt>.</li>

<li><em>Karl Berry</em> (karl@cs.umb.edu) wrote the <tt>kpathsea</tt>
library that allows Octave to recursively search directory paths for
function and script files.</li>

<li><em>Georg Beyerle</em> (gbeyerle@awi-potsdam.de) contributed code
to save values in Matlab's <tt>.mat</tt>-file format, and has provided
many useful bug reports and suggestions.</li>

<li><em>John Campbell</em> (jcc@bevo.che.wisc.edu) wrote most of the
file and C-style input and output functions.</li>

<li><em>Brian Fox</em> (bfox@gnu.ai.mit.edu) wrote the
<tt>readline</tt> library used for command history editing, and the
portion of this manual that documents it.</li>

<li><em>Klaus Gebhardt</em>
(gebhardt@crunch.ikp.physik.th-darmstadt.de) ported Octave to OS/2 and
worked with <em>Michel Juillard</em> (juillard@msh-paris.fr) on the
port to DOS.</li>

<li><em>A. Scottedward Hodel</em> (scotte@eng.auburn.edu) contributed
a number of functions including <tt>expm</tt>, <tt>qzval</tt>,
<tt>qzhess</tt>, <tt>syl</tt>, <tt>lyap</tt>, and
<tt>balance</tt>.</li>

<li><em>Kurt Hornik</em> (Kurt.Hornik@ci.tuwien.ac.at) has written and
documented many functions for Octave, rewrote and documented the Emacs
mode for editing Octave code, and has helped tremendously with
testing.  He has also been a constant source of new ideas for
improving Octave.</li>

<li><em>Phil Johnson</em> (johnsonp@nicco.sscnet.ucla.edu) has helped
to make Linux releases available.</li>

<li><em>Michel Juillard</em> (juillard@msh-paris.fr) ported Octave to
DOS systems.</li>

<li><em>Friedrich Leisch</em> (leisch@ci.tuwien.ac.at) provided the
<tt>mahalanobis</tt> function.</li>

<li><em>Ken Neighbors</em> (wkn@leland.stanford.edu) has provided many
useful bug reports and comments on Matlab compatibility.</li>

<li><em>Rick Niles</em> (niles@axp745.gsfc.nasa.gov) rewrote Octave's
plotting functions to add line styles and the ability to specify an
unlimited number of lines in a single call.  He also continues to
track down odd incompatibilities and bugs.</li>

<li><em>Mark Odegard</em> (meo@sugarland.unocal.com) provided the
initial implementation of <tt>fread</tt>, <tt>fwrite</tt>,
<tt>feof</tt>, and <tt>ferror</tt>.</li>

<li><em>Tony Richardson</em> (tony@guts.biomed.uakron.edu) wrote
Octave's image processing functions as well as most of the original
polynomial functions.</li>

<li><em>R. Bruce Tenison</em> (Bruce.Tenison@eng.auburn.edu) wrote the
<tt>hess</tt> and <tt>schur</tt> functions.</li>

<li><em>Teresa Twaroch</em> (twaroch@ci.tuwien.ac.at) provided the
functions <tt>gls</tt> and <tt>ols</tt>.</li>

<li><em>Andreas Weingessel</em> (Andreas.Weingessel@ci.tuwien.ac.at)
wrote the audio functions <tt>lin2mu</tt>, <tt>loadaudio</tt>,
<tt>mu2lin</tt>, <tt>playaudio</tt>, <tt>record</tt>,
<tt>saveaudio</tt>, and <tt>setaudio</tt>.</li>

<li><em>Fook Fah Yap</em> (ffy@eng.cam.ac.uk) provided the
<tt>fft</tt> and <tt>ifft</tt> functions and valuable bug reports for
early versions.
</ul>
