@cindex installing Octave

Here is the procedure for installing Octave from scratch on a Unix
system.  For instructions on how to install the binary distributions of
Octave, see @ref{Binary Distributions}.

@itemize @bullet
@item
Run the shell script @file{configure}.  This will determine the features
your system has (or doesn't have) and create a file named
@file{Makefile} from each of the files named @file{Makefile.in}.

Here is a summary of the configure options that are most frequently used
when building Octave:

@table @code
@item --prefix=@var{prefix}
Install Octave in subdirectories below @var{prefix}.  The default value
of @var{prefix} is @file{/usr/local}.

@item --srcdir=@var{dir}
Look for Octave sources in the directory @var{dir}.

@item --with-f2c
Use f2c even if Fortran compiler is available.

@item --enable-dld
Use DLD to make Octave capable of dynamically linking
externally compiled functions.  This only works on systems that have a
working port of DLD.

@item --enable-lite-kernel
Compile smaller kernel.  This currently requires DLD so that Octave can
load functions at run time that are not loaded at compile time.

@item --help
Print a summary of the options recognized by the configure script.
@end table

See the file @file{INSTALL} for more information about the command line
options used by configure.  That file also contains instructions for
compiling in a directory other than where the source is located.

@item
Run make.

You will need a recent version of GNU make.  Modifying Octave's
makefiles to work with other make programs is probably not worth
your time.  We recommend you get and compile GNU make instead.

For plotting, you will need to have gnuplot installed on your system.
Gnuplot is a command-driven interactive function plotting program.
Gnuplot is copyrighted, but freely distributable.  The `gnu' in gnuplot
is a coincidence---it is not related to the GNU project or the FSF in
any but the most peripheral sense.

For version @value{VERSION}, you must have the GNU C++ compiler (gcc)
version 2.7.2 or later to compile Octave.  You will also need version
2.7.1 or 2.7.2 of the GNU C++ class library (libg++).  If you plan to
modify the parser you will also need GNU bison and fles.  If you modify
the documentation, you will need GNU Texinfo, along with the patch for
the makeinfo program that is distributed with Octave.

GNU make, gcc, and libg++, gnuplot, bison, flex, and Texinfo are all
available from many anonymous ftp archives.  The primary site is
prep.ai.mit.edu, but it is often very busy.  A list of sites that mirror
the software on prep is available by anonymous ftp from prep.ai.mit.edu
in the file @file{/pub/gnu/GNUinfo/FTP}, or by fingering
fsf@@prep.ai.mit.edu.

If you don't have a Fortran compiler, or if your Fortran compiler
doesn't work like the traditional Unix f77, you will need to have the
Fortran to C translator f2c.  You can get f2c from any
number of anonymous ftp archives.  The most recent version of f2c
is always available from netlib.att.com.

On an otherwise idle SPARCstation II, it will take somewhere between 60
and 90 minutes to compile everything, depending on whether you are
compiling the Fortran libraries with f2c or using the Fortran compiler
directly.  You will need about 50 megabytes of disk storage to work with
(considerably less if you don't compile with debugging symbols).  To do
that, use the command

@example
make CFLAGS=-O CXXFLAGS=-O LDFLAGS=
@end example

@noindent
instead of just @samp{make}.

@item
If you encounter errors while compiling Octave, first check the list of
known problems below to see if there is a workaround or solution for
your problem.  If not,
@ifclear INSTALLONLY
see @ref{Trouble},
@end ifclear
@ifset INSTALLONLY
see the file BUGS
@end ifset
for information about how to report bugs.

@item
Once you have successfully compiled Octave, run @samp{make install}.

This will install a copy of octave, its libraries, and its documentation
in the destination directory.  As distributed, Octave is installed in
the following directories.  In the table below, @var{prefix} defaults to
@file{/usr/local}, @var{version} stands for the current version number
of the interpreter, and @var{host_type} is the type of computer on which
Octave is installed (for example, @samp{i586-unknown-gnu}).

@table @file
@item @var{prefix}/bin
Octave and other binaries that people will want to run directly.

@item @var{prefix}/lib
Libraries like libcruft.a and liboctave.a.

@item @var{prefix}/share
Architecture-independent data files.

@item @var{prefix}/include/octave
Include files distributed with Octave.

@item @var{prefix}/man/man1
Unix-style man pages describing Octave.

@item @var{prefix}/info
Info files describing Octave.

@item @var{prefix}/share/octave/@var{version}/m
Function files distributed with Octave.  This includes the Octave
version, so that multiple versions of Octave may be installed at the
same time.

@item @var{prefix}/lib/octave/@var{version}/exec/@var{host_type}
Executables to be run by Octave rather than the user.

@item @var{prefix}/lib/octave/@var{version}/oct/@var{host_type}
Object files that will be dynamically loaded.

@item @var{prefix}/share/octave/@var{version}/imagelib
Image files that are distributed with Octave.

@node Installation Problems, Binary Distributions, Installation, Installation
@appendixsec Installation Problems
	
This section contains a list of problems (and some apparent problems
that don't really mean anything is wrong) that may show up during
installation of Octave.

@itemize @bullet
@item
On some SCO systems, @code{info} fails to compile if
@code{HAVE_TERMIOS_H} is defined int @file{config.h}.  Simply removing
the definition from @file{info/config.h} should allow it to compile.

@item
If @code{configure} finds @code{dlopen}, @code{dlsym}, @code{dlclose},
and @code{dlerror}, but not the header file @file{dlfcn.h}, you need to
find the source for the header file and install it in the directory
@file{usr/include}.  This is reportedly a problem with Slackware 3.1.
For Linux/GNU systems, the source for @file{dlfcn.h} is in the
@samp{ldso} package.

@item
If you encounter errors like

@smallexample
@group
passing `void (*)()' as argument 2 of
  `octave_set_signal_handler(int, void (*)(int))'
@end group
@end smallexample

@noindent
or

@smallexample
warning: ANSI C++ prohibits conversion from `(int)' to `(...)'
@end smallexample

@noindent
while compiling @file{sighandlers.cc}, you may need to edit some files
in the gcc include subdirectory to add proper prototypes for functions
there.  For example, Ultrix 4.2 needs proper declarations for the
@code{signal()} and the @code{SIG_IGN} macro in the file @file{signal.h}.

On some systems the @code{SIG_IGN} macro is defined to be something like
this:

@example
#define  SIG_IGN  (void (*)())1
@end example

@noindent
when it should really be something like:

@example
#define  SIG_IGN  (void (*)(int))1
@end example

@noindent
to match the prototype declaration for @code{signal()}.  This change
should also be made for the @code{SIG_DFL} and @code{SIG_ERR} symbols.
It may be necessary to change the definitions in @file{sys/signal.h} as
well.

The gcc fixincludes/fixproto script should probably fix these problems
when gcc installs its modified set of header files, but I don't think
that's been done yet.

@strong{You should not change the files in @file{/usr/include}}.  You
can find the gcc include directory tree by running the command

@example
gcc -print-libgcc-file-name
@end example

@noindent
The directory of gcc include files normally begins in the same directory
that contains the file @file{libgcc.a}.

@item
There is a bug with the makeinfo program that is distributed with
Texinfo (through version 3.9) that causes the indices in Octave's
on-line manual to be generated incorrectly.  If you need to recreate the
on-line documentation, you should get the makeinfo program that is
distributed with texinfo-3.9 and apply the patch for makeinfo that is
distributed with Octave.  See the file @file{MAKEINFO.PATCH} for more
details.

@item
Some of the Fortran subroutines may fail to compile with older versions
of the Sun Fortran compiler.  If you get errors like

@smallexample
zgemm.f:
	zgemm:
warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
zgemm.f, line 245: warning: unexpected parent of complex
  expression subtree
warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
zgemm.f, line 304: warning: unexpected parent of complex
  expression subtree
warning: unexpected parent of complex expression subtree
zgemm.f, line 327: warning: unexpected parent of complex
  expression subtree
pcc_binval: missing IR_CONV in complex op
make[2]: *** [zgemm.o] Error 1
@end smallexample

@noindent
when compiling the Fortran subroutines in the @file{libcruft}
subdirectory, you should either upgrade your compiler or try compiling
with optimization turned off.

@item
On NeXT systems, if you get errors like this:

@example
/usr/tmp/cc007458.s:unknown:Undefined local symbol LBB7656
/usr/tmp/cc007458.s:unknown:Undefined local symbol LBE7656
@end example

@noindent
when compiling @file{Array.cc} and @file{Matrix.cc}, try recompiling
these files without @code{-g}.

@item
Some people have reported that calls to shell_cmd and the pager do not
work on SunOS systems.  This is apparently due to having
@code{G_HAVE_SYS_WAIT} defined to be 0 instead of 1 when compiling
libg++.

@item
On NeXT systems, linking to @file{libsys_s.a} may fail to resolve the
following functions

@example
_tcgetattr
_tcsetattr
_tcflow
@end example

@noindent
which are part of @file{libposix.a}.  Unfortunately, linking Octave with
@code{-posix} results in the following undefined symbols.

@example
.destructors_used
.constructors_used
_objc_msgSend
_NXGetDefaultValue
_NXRegisterDefaults
.objc_class_name_NXStringTable
.objc_class_name_NXBundle
@end example

One kluge around this problem is to extract @file{termios.o} from
@file{libposix.a}, put it in Octave's @file{src} directory, and add it
to the list of files to link together in the makefile.  Suggestions for
better ways to solve this problem are welcome!

@item
If Octave crashes immediately with a floating point exception, it is
likely that it is failing to initialize the IEEE floating point values
for infinity and NaN.

If your system actually does support IEEE arithmetic, you should be able
to fix this problem by modifying the function @code{octave_ieee_init} in
the file @file{lo-ieee.cc} to correctly initialize Octave's internal
infinity and NaN variables.

If your system does not support IEEE arithmetic but Octave's configure
script incorrectly determined that it does, you can work around the
problem by editing the file @file{config.h} to not define
@code{HAVE_ISINF}, @code{HAVE_FINITE}, and @code{HAVE_ISNAN}.

In any case, please report this as a bug since it might be possible to
modify Octave's configuration script to automatically determine the
proper thing to do.

@item
If you don't have NPSOL but you still want to be able to solve NLPs, or
if you don't have QPSOL but you still want to solve QPs, you'll need to
find replacements or order them from Stanford.  If you know of a freely
redistributable replacement, please let us know---we might be interested
in distributing it with Octave.

You can get more information about NPSOL and QPSOL from

Octave may soon support FSQP, an NLP solver from Andre Tits

To install Octave from a binary distribution, execute the command

@example

@noindent
in the top level directory of the distribution.

Binary distributions are normally compiled assuming that Octave will be
installed in the following subdirectories of @file{/usr/local}.

@table @file

Octave and other binaries that people will want to run directly.

@item man/man1
Unix-style man pages describing Octave.

@item lib/octave/@var{version}/exec/@var{host_type}
Executables to be run by Octave rather than the user.

@item lib/octave/@var{version}/oct/@var{host_type}
Object files that will be dynamically loaded.

@item lib/octave/@var{version}/imagelib
Image files that are distributed with Octave.
@end table

@noindent
where @var{version} stands for the current version number of the
interpreter, and @var{host_type} is the type of computer on which Octave
is installed (for example, @samp{i486-unknown-gnu}).

If these directories don't exist, the script @file{doinstall.sh} will
create them for you.

If it is not possible for you to install Octave in @file{/usr/local}, or
if you would prefer to install it in a different directory, you can
specify the name of the top level directory as an argument to the
doinstall.sh script.  For example:

@example
sh ./doinstall.sh /some/other/directory
@end example

@noindent
will install Octave in subdirectories of the directory
@file{/some/other/directory}.

@node Creating a Binary Distribution,  , Installing Octave from a Binary Distribution, Binary Distributions
@appendixsubsec Creating a Binary Distribution

Here is how to build a binary distribution for others.

@itemize @bullet
@item
You must build Octave in the same directory as the source.  This is
required since the @samp{binary-dist} targets in the makefiles will not
work if you compile outside the source tree.

@item
Use @samp{CFLAGS=-O CXXFLAGS=-O LDFLAGS=} as arguments for Make because
most people who get the binary distributions are probably not going to
be interested in debugging Octave.

@item
Type @samp{make binary-dist}.  This will build everything and then pack
it up for distribution.
