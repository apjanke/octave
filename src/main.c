@mainpage Source code documentation for GNU Octave

GNU Octave is a high-level language, primarily intended for numerical
computations.  It provides a convenient interactive command line
interface for solving linear and nonlinear problems numerically, and
for performing other numerical experiments.  It may also be used as a
batch-oriented language for data processing.

GNU Octave is free software. You may redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/">GNU
General Public License</a> as published by the Free Software Foundation.

This is the developer documentation for Octave's own source code. It is
intended to help for hacking Octave. It may also be useful for
understanding the Octave API when writing your own .oct files.
