Octave works best with recent beta releases of gnuplot 4.0, which are
available from http://www.gnuplot.info.

Hint: Under X11, please put

  set mouse

into your $HOME/.gnuplot file so that you may manipulate the plot
window using the mouse (see the gnuplot FAQ for more details).

Note that this is not necessary for the current development version of
gnuplot 4.1.
