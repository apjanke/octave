Summary of important user-visible changes for version 5.0 (yyyy-mm-dd):
----------------------------------------------------------------------

 ** The functions issymmetric and ishermitian accept an option "nonskew"
    or "skew" to calculate the symmetric or skew-symmetric property
    of a matrix.  Performance has also been increased.

 ** Figure graphic objects have a new property "Number" which is
    read-only and will return the handle (number) of the figure.
    However, if the property "IntegerHandle" has been set to "off" then
    the property will return an empty matrix ([]).

 ** Deprecated functions.

    The following functions have been deprecated in Octave 5.0 and will
    be removed from Octave 7 (or whatever version is the second major
    release after 5.0):
