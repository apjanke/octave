*     ..
*
*     Purpose
*     =======
*
*     SLAQR0 computes the eigenvalues of a Hessenberg matrix H
*     and, optionally, the matrices T and Z from the Schur decomposition
*     H = Z T Z**T, where T is an upper quasi-triangular matrix (the
*     Schur form), and Z is the orthogonal matrix of Schur vectors.
*
*     Optionally Z may be postmultiplied into an input orthogonal
*     matrix Q so that this routine can give the Schur factorization
*     of a matrix A which has been reduced to the Hessenberg form H
*     by the orthogonal matrix Q:  A = Q*H*Q**T = (QZ)*T*(QZ)**T.
*
*     Arguments
*     =========
*
*     WANTT   (input) LOGICAL
*          = .TRUE. : the full Schur form T is required;
*          = .FALSE.: only eigenvalues are required.
*
*     WANTZ   (input) LOGICAL
*          = .TRUE. : the matrix of Schur vectors Z is required;
*          = .FALSE.: Schur vectors are not required.
*
*     N     (input) INTEGER
*           The order of the matrix H.  N .GE. 0.
*
*     ILO   (input) INTEGER
*     IHI   (input) INTEGER
*           It is assumed that H is already upper triangular in rows
*           and columns 1:ILO-1 and IHI+1:N and, if ILO.GT.1,
*           H(ILO,ILO-1) is zero. ILO and IHI are normally set by a
*           previous call to SGEBAL, and then passed to SGEHRD when the
*           matrix output by SGEBAL is reduced to Hessenberg form.
*           Otherwise, ILO and IHI should be set to 1 and N,
*           respectively.  If N.GT.0, then 1.LE.ILO.LE.IHI.LE.N.
*           If N = 0, then ILO = 1 and IHI = 0.
*
*     H     (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDH,N)
*           On entry, the upper Hessenberg matrix H.
*           On exit, if INFO = 0 and WANTT is .TRUE., then H contains
*           the upper quasi-triangular matrix T from the Schur
*           decomposition (the Schur form); 2-by-2 diagonal blocks
*           (corresponding to complex conjugate pairs of eigenvalues)
*           are returned in standard form, with H(i,i) = H(i+1,i+1)
*           and H(i+1,i)*H(i,i+1).LT.0. If INFO = 0 and WANTT is
*           .FALSE., then the contents of H are unspecified on exit.
*           (The output value of H when INFO.GT.0 is given under the
*           description of INFO below.)
*
*           This subroutine may explicitly set H(i,j) = 0 for i.GT.j and
*           j = 1, 2, ... ILO-1 or j = IHI+1, IHI+2, ... N.
*
*     LDH   (input) INTEGER
*           The leading dimension of the array H. LDH .GE. max(1,N).
*
*     WR    (output) REAL array, dimension (IHI)
*     WI    (output) REAL array, dimension (IHI)
*           The real and imaginary parts, respectively, of the computed
*           eigenvalues of H(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI) are stored WR(ILO:IHI)
*           and WI(ILO:IHI). If two eigenvalues are computed as a
*           complex conjugate pair, they are stored in consecutive
*           elements of WR and WI, say the i-th and (i+1)th, with
*           WI(i) .GT. 0 and WI(i+1) .LT. 0. If WANTT is .TRUE., then
*           the eigenvalues are stored in the same order as on the
*           diagonal of the Schur form returned in H, with
*           WR(i) = H(i,i) and, if H(i:i+1,i:i+1) is a 2-by-2 diagonal
*           block, WI(i) = sqrt(-H(i+1,i)*H(i,i+1)) and
*           WI(i+1) = -WI(i).
*
*     ILOZ     (input) INTEGER
*     IHIZ     (input) INTEGER
*           Specify the rows of Z to which transformations must be
*           applied if WANTZ is .TRUE..
*           1 .LE. ILOZ .LE. ILO; IHI .LE. IHIZ .LE. N.
*
*     Z     (input/output) REAL array, dimension (LDZ,IHI)
*           If WANTZ is .FALSE., then Z is not referenced.
*           If WANTZ is .TRUE., then Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ) is
*           replaced by Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ)*U where U is the
*           orthogonal Schur factor of H(ILO:IHI,ILO:IHI).
*           (The output value of Z when INFO.GT.0 is given under
*           the description of INFO below.)
*
*     LDZ   (input) INTEGER
*           The leading dimension of the array Z.  if WANTZ is .TRUE.
*           then LDZ.GE.MAX(1,IHIZ).  Otherwize, LDZ.GE.1.
*
*     WORK  (workspace/output) REAL array, dimension LWORK
*           On exit, if LWORK = -1, WORK(1) returns an estimate of
*           the optimal value for LWORK.
*
*     LWORK (input) INTEGER
*           The dimension of the array WORK.  LWORK .GE. max(1,N)
*           is sufficient, but LWORK typically as large as 6*N may
*           be required for optimal performance.  A workspace query
*           to determine the optimal workspace size is recommended.
*
*           If LWORK = -1, then SLAQR0 does a workspace query.
*           In this case, SLAQR0 checks the input parameters and
*           estimates the optimal workspace size for the given
*           values of N, ILO and IHI.  The estimate is returned
*           in WORK(1).  No error message related to LWORK is
*           issued by XERBLA.  Neither H nor Z are accessed.
*
*
*     INFO  (output) INTEGER
*             =  0:  successful exit
*           .GT. 0:  if INFO = i, SLAQR0 failed to compute all of
*                the eigenvalues.  Elements 1:ilo-1 and i+1:n of WR
*                and WI contain those eigenvalues which have been
*                successfully computed.  (Failures are rare.)
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and WANT is .FALSE., then on exit,
*                the remaining unconverged eigenvalues are the eigen-
*                values of the upper Hessenberg matrix rows and
*                columns ILO through INFO of the final, output
*                value of H.
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and WANTT is .TRUE., then on exit
*
*           (*)  (initial value of H)*U  = U*(final value of H)
*
*                where U is an orthogonal matrix.  The final
*                value of H is upper Hessenberg and quasi-triangular
*                in rows and columns INFO+1 through IHI.
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and WANTZ is .TRUE., then on exit
*
*                  (final value of Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ)
*                   =  (initial value of Z(ILO:IHI,ILOZ:IHIZ)*U
*
*                where U is the orthogonal matrix in (*) (regard-
*                less of the value of WANTT.)
*
*                If INFO .GT. 0 and WANTZ is .FALSE., then Z is not
*                accessed.
